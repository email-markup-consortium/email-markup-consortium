## Notes

### Collecting sample emails for [Examine Email](https://examine.email/)

- Parcel (EMC sponsor) tool
- can be used on emails EMC collected in the Data Collection project (via API?)
- Why?
  - another meta data
  - allow us to trail emails back to sender tool (e.g. emails sent by tool X often has accessibility issues)
- How?
  - Parcel details how you can help on their [announcement blog post](https://parcel.io/blog/examine-email#a-favor-to-ask)

### Financing and sponsorship

- EMC is being offered money as a form of sponsorship
- EMC needs a way to pay for things
- Receiving money
  - Solutions for open source projects: Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors stand out
  - Open Collective
    - Using a Fiscal Host means we don't need to manage taxes
    - Don't need to withdraw right away
    - Fiscal Host takes a percentage of the money
    - Expenses/withdrawals are transparent
    - GitHub Sponsors can be connected to Open Collective if needed
    - Withdrawals can be made to a PayPal account or to a bank account in a country where wise.com is available
- Spending money
  - Joint PayPal account?
  - Virtual card?
    - Open Collective offers [virtual cards](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/virtual-cards)
  - Edge cases: Individual pays out of their own money and we can reimburse them via Open Collective

### Bug Reporting: 1&1 email clients

- First email client collaboration ðŸŽ‰
- [Private repository](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-bugs-1and1) created
  - request access if interested
- NOT looking for lack of support for CSS properties just because they would make developers life easier
- What to test? Examples:
  - Semantic HTML elements
  - Accessibility related features (e.g `aria-*` attributes)
  - Default CSS styles that may cause unintentional issues
- How to report?
  - Use the GitHub issue template and fill in the relevant information
- Ask 1&1 for default CSS styles and sanitizer allowed list
- Can I Email?
  - EMC is working to add 1&1 email clients to Can I Email?
  - Mark Robbins has access to the main repository. He is working on this in a [separate branch](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/tree/gmx-webde-1and1)
  - To contribute, you will need to communicate with Mark Robbins and RÃ©mi Parmentier
  - Fork Can I Email? in the EMC GitHub organisation for easier collaboration?

### Can I Email? tags/categories

- EMC helped categorise a good number of features
- Missing categories?
  - DX (developer experience)?
  - Spec level (e.g. CSS spec level 4)?
- Remi created a [tags page](https://www.caniemail.com/tags/)
  - groups HTML/CSS features by tag
- Goal is to have a page that lists a breakdown of email client support in each category. Example:
  - Email Client X
    - accessibility 3/10
    - performance 4/4
  - Email Client Y
    - accessibility 6/10
    - .....
- Add this data to the existing [Compare email clients page](https://www.caniemail.com/clients/)?
- Build a separate page on Can I Email?
- Use the JSON data and build a separate page off Can I Email?

### [Email Platform Status](https://www.emailplatformstatus.com/)
- [Discussion thread](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/discussions/41)
- What data would you like this to list?
  - Hacks (e.g. targeting hacks like those listed in [howtotarget.email](https://howtotarget.email))
  - Frameworks (MJML, Maizzle, etc.)
  - Image formats
  - External resources (e.g. CSS)
  - HTML attributes
  - Expand @media 
  - Typos and/or invalid features?
    - if features are checked against valid features, we would be able to see invalid features
- Make data available publicly in a data-interchange format (e.g. JSON)
  - would allow EMC and other parties to combine and analyze data from multiple sources (e.g. Can I Email?, Email Platform Status, Data Collection basic meta data)
