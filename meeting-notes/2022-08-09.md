## Notes

### Updates

- [Projects listed on website](https://emailmarkup.org/en/projects/)
  - more transparent on what we are working on (or plan to work on)
  - potentials sponsors can see where their money is going towards
- Email Default Styles
  - recently approved project
  - work has started
  - project now has its own GitHub repository

### Email Clients: ranking by feature category

- EMC contributed to Can I Email? by categorizing features based on benefit they provide
  - [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/discussions/40#discussioncomment-2202448)
  - [Issue on Can I Email? repository](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/caniemail/issues/232)
- Categories listed on the [caniemail.com/tags](https://www.caniemail.com/tags/)
- Data available in [JSON format](https://www.caniemail.com/api/data.json)
- Goal: visualize this data per email client
- [Draft PR](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/emailmarkup.org/pull/24) to add this to the EMC website
- What should we name this page?
  - Open discussion on Slack and/or GitHub Discussion thread
- What details should this page include? Any remarks for data interpretation?
  - Gaps (e.g. not all performance-related featured have been tested)
  - Email client version / recency
  - Category summaries for further context
  - Technical requirements can vary per email clients which can impact what they can support. Native apps vs web apps that iframe the HTML email vs web apps that directly embed the HTML email
- How is this useful
  - data-backed discussion
  - highlights which email clients are ahead/behind
  - highlights features that have not been tested on caniemail.com (EMC can contribute to fill in the gap)
- Can this be used to provide some sort of score to rank email clients?
  - potentially
  - some work is needed until we can provide a fair score

### Partnerships vs Sponsorships vs Corporate Members

- Continued discussion from [last meeting](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/blob/main/meeting-notes/2022-07-26.md#partnerships)
- Website suggestion: add call to action to become partner/sponsor
- Partners must be associated with a project?
- Partners vs Sponsors
  - Sponsors - Paid support, contributing financially
  - Partners - Unpaid support, contributing with resources and labor
  - [Definitions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partnership-vs-sponsorship-how-different-does-matter-matt-wolff/):
    - "By definition, a partnership is an agreement between entities that pool their resources together to offer a product/service where they share in the revenue."
    - "By definition, a sponsorship is an agreement that exchanges money or services/products (in kind) for the right to be associated with a company/brand."
- 1&1 - trial partnerships
  - Not contributing to anything?
  - Still partners?
  - Valuable to EMC to highlight this sort of relationship
- Corporate supporters/members
  - Kickstarter example: all supporters must pay $1
  - Corporate application form: member = partner, otherwise a supported
  - Upon application EMC to communicate with applicant to confirm how they intend to help EMC through becoming a partner. If they don't qualify as a partner, they can still be listed as a supporter.
  - Reword support definition in application form
- Application form
  - Move away from Google forms? Google services not available everywhere (e.g. China)
  - Add newsletter opt-in in application form

### Email Client market share

- data collected from tracking pixels
  - We don't have access to such data
  - Can EMC partners provide this?
    - Precedent: https://www.litmus.com/email-client-market-share/
  - Not fully accurate
- Is collecting and publishing this data valuable to EMC?
  - More value to not knowing. Aim to make email as accessible as possible regardless.
  - Can be useful internally; help us strategize and figure out who to communicate with.
  - If for internal use only, still publish it? Useful to make our learnings public
  - can open our eyes to widely used email clients that we are not aware of or
- Example data source: App downloads/installs
  - https://sensortower.com/blog/top-email-apps-worldwide-april-2019-downloads
  - Google Play store: lists downloads
  - Huawei AppGallery: lists downloads
  - Apple Store: doesn't list downloads
  - can be used as an indication
  - as a metric this doesn't reflect actual usage

### Communicating to email clients

- If we reach out, why should they care?
- Why should they work with us?
- WIP doc: benefits to email clients
  - this doc should address such questions
