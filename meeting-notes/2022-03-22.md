  - other issue
- Description needs to be updated

#### Project details in Google Sheet

- A large Google Sheet that lists all projects has been set up
- Accessible to members only
- Used to list projects, project leaders, project description, project "home", project milestones and target dates

#### EMC calendar

- WIP
- Going to be a Google Calendar available for anyone to subscribe to

#### Roles and responsibilities

These are now [documented on GitHub](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/blob/main/roles-and-responsibilities.md)

#### Setting dates & milestones for rollout

- at a better stage to set reasonable dates
- discussing doing it in stages (e.g. announce it within Email Geeks Slack, then do a broader announcement at a later date)

#### Mailjet account üéâ

- Gmail account (EMC domain didn't work)
- Integrate Google Form (member application form) to Mailjet. Connect via Zapier?
- Where does the approved members list come from?

#### Website

- PR open with some styling enhancements and dark mode styles

### Branding

- Some exploration work was done a while ago
- Megan and Elle to sort out üôè
- Logo needed for EMC launch
  - may not be necessary on the website to get the message across
  - much needed elswhere (e.g. avatar-less Twitter account üëé)

### Assigning project leaders
- Projects are ready to be worked on
- For a project to move forward it must have:
  - at least 1 leader
  - at least 2 members (including leader)


## Actions

- Project leaders (admins): reach out to members and ask who'd like to step up as a leader (or join a project)
- Branding (Megan and Elle): pick up branding and work out a plan
- Mailjet integration (admins / Megan): work out how to get an approved members list from Google Form to Mailjet
- Rollout (admins): set reasonable target dates
