### Partnerships

- EMC's goal is to work with email clients and ESPs (or any service/web app that renders HTML emails for users)
- A partner could be a company that falls under the above categories
- Partnership vs Sponsorship
  - Not fully clear
  - A type of sponsorship?
  - A current way to sponsor EMC is to invest time and contribute directly to projects. How is this different?
  - A single company can be both
- Worth putting a label on it?
  - Too soon
  - Wait for official partnership
- Who to target?
  - Major email clients right away?
  - Start with open-source email clients first, then reach to major email clients once we have more solid documentations/solutions?
