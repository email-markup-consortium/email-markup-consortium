## Notes

### Progress updates
Logo - design is complete, voting on logo colors by this Friday (6th May).

Wedsite - needs to look more legit. Megan will do a quick design mock up, which Mark will code. Alice will do a squarespace mock up and can set up a free account. 

Slack channels - we will continue to use the private channel for members and set up a new public channel when we launch.  As new members apply we will manually add them to the private channel.  We may still set up our own slack/discord workspace in the future but will wait to see how much it's needed. 


## Action items
- Megan - create Slack Poll for logo colours
- Alice - mock up SQSP site
- Megan - First draft of Press Release (due 5/11)
- Mark -  put out Slack announcement on membership permissions
