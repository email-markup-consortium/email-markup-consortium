## Notes

### Updates

#### Newsletter Design

- Audience
  - Anyone who is signed up for EMC or has signed up for the newsletter
  - Still have to get newsletter signup form up and running
- Ideas on topics for the next newsletter?
  - Accessibility report (hero article)
  - Docs from website e.g. compliant standards
  - Accessibility hero/tip of the week/month
  - Share with your friends / share into relevant email communities / invite new sign ups

#### Corporate application form

- Reworded supporter/member/sponsor descriptions based on discussions we had during the last 2 meeting
- https://forms.gle/yifokDd3rfdFRG7i8

### Email Data Collection project

- Copyright concerns
  - How do others like [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) handle this?
- Potential funding source
  - The data source can be useful to other companies
  - Give access to other companies?
- Privacy concerns
  - newsletter/account confirmation emails may contain information like IP addresses
  - people used the collection email address to contact us (possibly because it was not obvious how they can contact us privately)
  - these must be addressed if we were to make the collected emails public or even if we provide other companies with access

### EMC Blog

- Any member can pitch an idea
- A member can also pitch an article they wrote to be published on EMC's blog
- Articles must align with EMC's goals

### Naming: page listing ranking of email clients by feature category

- Suggestions are welcome in https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/discussions/85

### Benefits to Email Clients

- WIP document started by Mark
- Topic was raised by Noah last meeting
- Highlight products can adopt standards but remain unique?
  - No competitive concerns
- Examples outside the email industry
  - Browsers
  - [Shipping containers](https://www.iso.org/news/ref2215.html) (not digital)
- Email forwarding
  - Each email client processes the quoted HTML message differently
  - leads to rendering issues
  - [Super Mail Forward](https://medium.com/emails-hteumeuleu/super-mail-forward-an-email-that-evolves-as-you-forward-it-84466596f30d) by Rémi Parmentier
- Add "Benefits to (ESPs / Developers)" documents similar to this one?

### EMC Goals

- Not all goals are clearly stated in docs?
- Minimum acceptable ‘floor’ of supported functionality (to support user experience, accessibility, performance, consistency, and reliability)
- Supporting graceful fallback to the ‘floor’
- No limit to innovation
