# Email Markup Consortium

This is the public repository used for Email Markup Consortium planning and discussion.

## Slack

The group is also gathering on the private #email-markup-consortium channel of the [Email Geeks Slack](https://email.geeks.chat/).

If you would like to join that channel:

1. Make sure you’re a member of the Slack community, or apply for membership
2. Reach out to any of the contributors either on Slack or using a new GitHub issue or discussion for an invitation to the private channel
