# Welcoming new members

Thank you for joining the EMC. We hope you can help us in [our mission](mission.md). Remember to be respectful of all members of the group and all opinions. Please see the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

## How we collaborate
### Forum
We aim to keep our discussions public whenever possible. This typically happens in the [Discussions](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/discussions) section of this repository which acts as our public forum.

### Chat
We also chat on Slack in the [Email Geeks Slack community](https://email.geeks.chat/) in the #email-markup-consortium channel. If you are an approved member and still do not have access to this channel, please contact [EMC admins](admins@emailmarkup.org).

### Members Meetings
A Members meeting takes place once a fortnight. You can subscribe to the [EMC Members Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=YTUyY3E0ZnEwYTVhdXIyb3FqNG9sN29zaGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) to check the latest meeting times.

You can always refer to [previous meetings notes](https://github.com/email-markup-consortium/email-markup-consortium/tree/main/meeting-notes) if you cannot attend.

There are no commitment expectations. You can take a very active role, or sit back, observe, and comment when you feel compelled.
