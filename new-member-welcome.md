# Welcoming new members

Thanks a lot for joining the group. We’re still at the very early stages.

Our main goals are around finding ways to improve email client HTML rendering with a strong focus on security, accessibility, resilience, performance, and future proofing.  Within the group we’re hoping to set up a number of projects to approach this from different angles. 

We don’t have a leader or any hierarchy at the moment. As the group grows we may need to have a little more structure. 

Remember to be respectful of all members of the group and all opinions. Please see the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

## How we collaborate
Currently we are discussing things in the [Email Standards Slack Channel](https://emailgeeks.slack.com/archives/C02C6TXA610) and on a weekly call on Tuesday at 5PM UK time (12 noon East Coast US / 9am West Coast US). [This link can help you convert to other timezones](https://www.inyourowntime.zone/2021-08-24_17.00_Europe.London?forget=1). (Be aware that clocks change in the UK on 31st October so the meeting time also changes then.)

Once we have things more set up we are planning on cutting the weekly call back to a fortnightly or monthly call. We are also planning on a public forum to have more open discussion and allow more members of the community to share ideas. And a public website to publish our documentation.

[Notes from previous calls can be found here](https://github.com/email-standards/email-standards/tree/main/meeting-notes). Also there is an agenda at the top of the page for the next call. Please feel free to add items for discussion.

There are no commitment expectations. You can take a very active role, or sit back, observe, and comment when you feel compelled.
